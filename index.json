We propose a novel and general Dependency-Aware Decoder (DePA) to enhance target dependency modeling in the decoder of fully NAT models from two perspectives, decoder self-attention and decoder input. First, we propose an autoregressive forward-backward pre-training phase before NAT training, which enables the NAT decoder to gradually learn bidirectional target dependencies for the final NAT training. Second, we transform the decoder input from the source language representation space to the target language representation space through a novel attentive transformation process, which enables the decoder to better capture target dependencies. DePA can be applied to any fully NAT models. Extensive experiments show that DePA consistently improves highly competitive and state-of-the-art fully NAT models on widely used WMT and IWSLT benchmarks by up to 1.88 BLEU gain, while maintaining the inference latency comparable to other fully NAT models.","tags":[],"title":"DePA: Improving Non-autoregressive Translation with Dependency-Aware Decoder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Bai","Heyan Huang","Kai Fan","Yang Gao","Yiming Zhu","Jiaao Zhan","Zewen Chi","Boxing Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643673600,"objectID":"35c89c00eb78031bcd8d7ddf59c39f37","permalink":"https://ybai-nlp.github.io/publication/crcls/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/crcls/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we propose a novel task, Cross-lingual Summarization with Compression rate (CSC), to benefit Cross-Lingual Summarization by large-scale Machine Translation corpus. Through introducing compression rate, the information ratio between the source and the target text, we regard the MT task as a special CLS task with a compression rate of 100%. Hence they can be trained as a unified task, sharing knowledge more effectively. However, a huge gap exists between the MT task and the CLS task, where samples with compression rates between 30% and 90% are extremely rare.  Hence, to bridge these two tasks smoothly, we propose an effective data augmentation method to produce document-summary pairs with different compression rates. The proposed method not only improves the performance of the CLS task, but also provides controllability to generate summaries in desired lengths. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms various strong baselines in three cross-lingual summarization datasets.

To support it, we developed a novel soft prompts architecture coupled with a prompt pre-training plus prompt fine-tuning paradigm, which is effective and tunes only extremely light parameters. To meet the structure of the generation models, the soft prompts comprise continuous input embeddings across an encoder and a decoder. Importantly, a new inner-prompt placed in the text is introduced to capture document-level information. The aim is to devote attention to understanding the document that better prompts the model to generate document-related content. In the training process, the prompt pre-training with self-supervised pseudo-data firstly teaches the model basic summarizing capability. Then, with few-shot examples, only the designed lightweight soft prompts are fine-tuned. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail and XSum datasets show that our method, with only 0.1% of the parameters, outperforms full-model tuning where all model parameters are tuned. It also surpasses Prompt Tuning by a large margin and delivers competitive results against Prefix-Tuning with 3% of the parameters.","tags":[],"title":"PSP: Pre-trained Soft Prompts for Few-Shot Abstractive Summarization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiaao Zhan","Yang Gao","Yu Bai","Qianhui Liu"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"7ac6e7edef3ebc4bc4213ecce841dd33","permalink":"https://ybai-nlp.github.io/publication/stage/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stage/","section":"publication","summary":"A quality headline with a high click-rate should not only summarize the content of an article, but also reflect a style that attracts users. Such demand has drawn rising attention to the task of stylistic headline generation (SHG). An intuitive method is to first generate plain headlines leveraged by documentheadline parallel data then transfer them to a target style. However, this inevitably suffers from error propagation. Therefore, to unify the two sub-tasks and explicitly decompose style-relevant attributes and summarize content, we propose an end-to-end stage-wise SHG model containing the style generation component and the content insertion component, where the former generates stylistic-relevant intermediate outputs and the latter receives these outputs then inserts the summarized content. The intermediate outputs are observable, making the style generation easy to control. Our system is comprehensively evaluated by both quantitative and qualitative metrics, and it achieves state-of-the-art results in SHG over three different stylistic datasets.","tags":[],"title":"Stage-wise Stylistic Headline Generation: Style Generation and Summarized Content Insertion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Bai","Yang Gao","Heyan Huang"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"913567d163195066e2591639568ecbd5","permalink":"https://ybai-nlp.github.io/publication/cls/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cls/","section":"publication","summary":"Parallel cross-lingual summarization data is scarce, requiring models to better use the limited available cross-lingual resources. Existing methods to do so often adopt sequence-to-sequence networks with multi-task frameworks. Such approaches apply multiple decoders, each of which is utilized for a specific task. However, these independent decoders share no parameters, hence fail to capture the relationships between the discrete phrases of summaries in different languages, breaking the connections in order to transfer the knowledge of the high-resource languages to low-resource languages. To bridge these connections, we propose a novel Multi-Task framework for Cross-Lingual Abstractive Summarization (MCLAS) in a low-resource setting. Employing one unified decoder to generate the sequential concatenation of monolingual and cross-lingual summaries, MCLAS makes the monolingual summarization task a prerequisite of the cross-lingual summarization (CLS) task. In this way, the shared decoder learns interactions involving alignments and summary patterns across languages, which encourages attaining knowledge transfer. Experiments on two CLS datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms three baseline models in both low-resource and full-dataset scenarios. Moreover, in-depth analysis on the generated summaries and attention heads verifies that interactions are learned well using MCLAS, which benefits the CLS task under limited parallel resources.","tags":[],"title":"Cross-Lingual Abstractive Summarization with Limited Parallel Resources","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haonan Wang","Yang Gao","Yu Bai","Mirella Lapata","Heyan Huang"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"2e8d7d593c9e95d0ebb317ec3b23cedf","permalink":"https://ybai-nlp.github.io/publication/esca/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/esca/","section":"publication","summary":"Like humans, document summarization models can interpret a document's contents in a number of ways. Unfortunately, the neural models of today are largely black boxes that provide little explanation of how or why they generated a summary in the way they did. Therefore, to begin prying open the black box and to inject a level of control into the substance of the final summary, we developed a novel select-and-generate framework that focuses on explainability. By revealing the latent centrality and interactions between sentences, along with scores for sentence novelty and relevance, users are given a window into the choices a model is making and an opportunity to guide those choices in a more desirable direction. A novel pair-wise matrix captures the sentence interactions, centrality, and attribute scores, and a mask with tunable attribute thresholds allows the user to control which sentences are likely to be included in the extraction. A sentence-deployed attention mechanism in the abstractor ensures the final summary emphasizes the desired content. Additionally, the encoder is adaptable, supporting both Transformer- and BERT-based configurations. In a series of experiments assessed with ROUGE metrics and two human evaluations, ESCA outperformed eight state-of-the-art models on the CNN/DailyMail and NYT50 benchmark datasets.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring Explainable Selection to Control Abstractive Summarization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Bai","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

In this study, we proposed a new multi-perspective answer reranking technique that considers all documents to verify the confidence of candidate answers; such nuanced technique can carefully distinguish candidate answers to improve performance. Specifically, we rearrange the order of traditional pipeline model and make a posterior answer reranking instead of prior passage reranking.
